      description: "...",
      date: "2025-11-15",

      venue: "Location",
      image: null,
      video: null,
      createdAt: "2025-10-31T..."
    }
  ],
  "EE": [...],
  ...

  // ...
}

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Data not persisting**
- Ensure localStorage is enabled in browser
- Check if browser is in private/incognito mode
- Try clearing browser cache

**Issue: Media not uploading**
- Verify file format (images: any, videos: MP4 only)
- Check file size (localStorage limit ~10MB)
- Try uploading a smaller file

**Issue: Login not working**
- Verify department code is uppercase (e.g., CS not cs)
- Check password matches exactly
- See TESTING_GUIDE.md for demo credentials
